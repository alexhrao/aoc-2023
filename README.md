# Advent of Code 2023

This is my repository for AoC 2023. I'm in the process of learning Rust, so I'm using this as an opportunity to practice my skills!

The Table of Contents has been (lovingly) ripped from @savbell's [great AoC repository](https://github.com/savbell/advent-of-code-one-liners/tree/master).
